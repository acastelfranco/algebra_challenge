A \char`\"{}raceway\char`\"{} is a directed acyclic graph. The edges of the graph are \char`\"{}segments\char`\"{} and the vertices are \char`\"{}endpoints\char`\"{}. Endpoints have positions in a 3D Cartesian space. Segments are straight lines between their start and end endpoints. Segments are always at least 5 units long.

\mbox{\hyperlink{class_raceway}{Raceway}} segments need to be held up by a sequence of \char`\"{}supports\char`\"{}. Every support should be thought of as being located at a point along a segment. Each segment requires at least two supports located exactly 1 unit from both endpoints. Also, the distance between two adjacent supports along a segment must not exceed 10 units. Supports should be evenly spaced along the segment. Finally, if more than two segments are adjacent to the same endpoint, the endpoint needs to be \char`\"{}reinforced\char`\"{}.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Exercise}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
The primary challenge in this exercise is to implement an algorithm to compute support positions for the raceway, and to specify which endpoints need to be reinforced. All good code has associated unit tests, so there is some infrastructure for writing tests for the support computation. The secondary challenge is to fill out some parts of the test infrastructure.

Look for {\ttfamily assert(!\char`\"{}unimplemented\char`\"{})} in the code, remove these asserts, and fill in the required code instead. The header files include documentation about the methods that need to be implemented. Specifically, you should make changes to\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{_raceway_8cpp}{Raceway.\+cpp}}}
\item {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{_test_data_8cpp}{Test\+Data.\+cpp}}}
\item {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{compute__supports_8cpp}{compute\+\_\+supports.\+cpp}}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Also, in {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{_raceway_8h}{Raceway.\+h}}}, you may add additional data members to the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_raceway}{Raceway}}} class if you like. Otherwise, keep the interfaces the same. Make sure all the tests in {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{tests_8cpp}{tests.\+cpp}}} pass (i.\+e. that the {\ttfamily supports} executable runs without any assertions).
